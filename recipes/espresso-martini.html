    <h3>The Espresso Martini is a classic cocktail made combining Vodka, Coffee Liqueur, Sugar and Espresso.</h3>

        <p>Invented in the mid 1980s, this cocktail is said to have been created by Dick Bradsell when a famous model asked him for a 
        drink that would <em>"wake me up and f*** me up"</em>.</p>
