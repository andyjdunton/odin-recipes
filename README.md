First Project - Recipe Website

My first project as part of TOP curriculum.

The assignment is to create a recipe page (I will be showcasing cocktail 
recipes, not food) using HTML and demonstrate knowledge on how to
create an index, link to different pages, add images, text, formatting and
both ordered and unordered lists.
